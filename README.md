# Lasso-Regression

Lasso regression is a type of linear regression with L1 regularization. L1 regularization is a form of regularization technique in machine learning to avoid overfitting. L1 also helps in factoring out non-essential features in the data by making the coefficients zero, hence it is also called as feature selection technique. In this code, I have developed a lasso regression model for a sample synthetic dataset. I have also developed a code to include sparse matrix concept to efficiently write an ML code without using too much memory. Sparse matrix concept helps in developing efficient ML codes. This concept helped me understand how to save space while developing huge ML models. I developed this code with the help of my teammate and was guided during my study on Introduction to Advanced Machine Learning course at UW, Seattle.
